## Known Issues

### Critical
None - All critical blocking issues resolved.

### High Priority
1. **Docker dependency** - Deployment blocked if Docker not running
   - Impact: Cannot deploy to Kubernetes
   - Workaround: Ensure Docker is running before deployment
   - Fix: Add better Docker detection and user guidance

### Medium Priority
1. **Incomplete idempotency** - bin/install-base may fail if run twice
   - Impact: Re-running install-base produces errors
   - Workaround: Delete spaces before re-running (or ignore errors)
   - Fix: Add existence checks before creation

2. **Missing usage messages** - health-check and validate-deployment lack --help
   - Impact: Reduced user experience
   - Workaround: Read script source or README
   - Fix: Add usage message blocks

3. **Security remediations pending** - 6 CRITICAL security findings for production
   - Impact: Not production-ready for financial services compliance
   - Workaround: Only deploy to development environments
   - Fix: Implement Phase 1 security remediations (see SECURITY-REVIEW.md)

### Low Priority
1. **Integration tests not run** - test/integration/test-deployment.sh not executed
   - Impact: Live deployment behavior not validated
   - Workaround: Unit tests provide good coverage
   - Fix: Run against test cluster before production

2. **No log rotation** - logs/ directory grows unbounded
   - Impact: Disk space usage over time
   - Workaround: Manual cleanup
   - Fix: Add log rotation policy

## Migration Guide

### From Manual kubectl to ConfigHub

If you were previously deploying with kubectl:

```bash
# Old way (kubectl)
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# New way (ConfigHub)
bin/install-base
bin/install-envs
bin/apply-all dev
```

### From Tilt to ConfigHub Worker

If you were using Tilt for development:

```bash
# Old way (Tilt)
tilt up

# New way (ConfigHub worker)
bin/setup-worker dev
# Worker now auto-deploys changes from ConfigHub
```
