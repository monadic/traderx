# TraderX Dashboard Status

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Ready for Testing

## Summary

Successfully deployed TraderX with database writes working. Dashboard is accessible and awaiting user testing.

## Working Components

### Database ✅
- **Status**: Running with schema and sample data
- **File**: `/app/_data/traderx.mv.db` (28KB)
- **Schema**: Accounts, AccountUsers, Positions, Trades tables created
- **Sample Data**: 7 accounts with users, trades, and positions
- **Test Account Created**: ID 65000 via direct API call

### Account Service ✅
- **Status**: Running and connected to database
- **Endpoint**: http://account-service:18088/account/
- **Test**: `POST /account/` successfully created account ID 65000
- **Database Writes**: Confirmed working

### Web Dashboard ✅
- **Status**: Running on port 18093
- **Angular Build**: Completed successfully (44.352 seconds)
- **Bundle Size**: 1.88 MB (main + styles + polyfills)
- **Access**: Port-forward to localhost:8080
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080

## Configuration Changes

### Database Deployment
Added command to run initialization script:
```yaml
command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "./run.sh"]
env:
  - name: DATABASE_DATA_DIR
    value: "/app/_data"
```

### Account Service
Simplified to minimal configuration:
```yaml
env:
  - name: ACCOUNT_SERVICE_PORT
    value: "18088"
  - name: DATABASE_TCP_HOST
    value: "database"
```

### Web-GUI
Increased memory for Angular production build:
```yaml
ports:
  - containerPort: 18093
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "768Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "1536Mi"
    cpu: "1000m"
```

Service port: 18093 (matching chanwit pattern)

## Known Issues

### Memory Constraints
- Kind cluster has limited memory
- Scaled down position-service and trade-processor to free memory
- Web-GUI requires 768Mi+ for Angular production build

### API Routing
- Angular app is client-side (runs in browser)
- Browser makes API requests from JavaScript
- Need to test if browser can reach backend services
- May require Ingress controller for proper routing

## Current Deployment

**Running Pods** (7/9):
```
✅ database              (1/1 Running)
✅ account-service       (1/1 Running)
✅ web-gui               (1/1 Running)
✅ people-service        (1/1 Running)
✅ reference-data        (1/1 Running)
✅ trade-feed            (1/1 Running)
✅ trade-service         (1/1 Running)
❌ position-service      (scaled to 0 for memory)
❌ trade-processor       (scaled to 0 for memory)
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080 in browser
2. **Try to Create Account**: Use the UI to create a new account
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for API requests and errors
4. **Report Results**: Share what happens (success/error messages)

## Direct API Test Results

Successfully tested database writes directly:
```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/account/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName":"Test Account via API"}'

{"id":65000,"displayName":"Test Account via API"}
```

✅ Database writes confirmed working
✅ Account service operational
✅ Database schema properly initialized

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Open dashboard and attempt account creation
2. **Routing Solution**:
   - If browser can't reach services: Install nginx-ingress controller
   - If CORS errors: Configure CORS on backend services
   - If successful: Document the working configuration

## Port-Forwards

Active port-forwards for testing:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n traderx-dev svc/web-gui 8080:18093
# Dashboard at http://localhost:8080
```

## Files Modified

1. `confighub/base/database-deployment.yaml` - Added run.sh command and DATA_DIR
2. `confighub/base/account-service-deployment.yaml` - Minimal configuration
3. `confighub/base/account-service-service.yaml` - Fixed port to 18088
4. `confighub/base/web-gui-deployment.yaml` - Increased memory, port 18093
5. `confighub/base/web-gui-service.yaml` - Service port 18093
6. `confighub/base/position-service-deployment.yaml` - Added HTTP health probes

## Lessons Learned from Chanwit's TraderX

✅ **Implemented**:
1. HTTP health probes on position-service
2. Container port 18093 for web-gui
3. Higher memory allocation for Angular production build

⏸️ **Deferred**:
1. Database replicas: 2 (memory constraints in kind cluster)
2. Combined manifests (Deployment + Service)
3. Numbered file prefixes (00-, 10-, 20-)

## Summary

**Database writes are working!** Successfully tested via direct API call. The dashboard is built and running. Next step is for the user to test account creation through the web UI to verify end-to-end functionality.
