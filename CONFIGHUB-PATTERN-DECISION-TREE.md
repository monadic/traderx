## 📊 Pattern Comparison Cheat Sheet

| Aspect | Simplified | Global-App |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Spaces** | 3 (dev, staging, prod) | 6+ (base, infra, filters, regions) |
| **Learning Curve** | 5 minutes | 2-4 hours |
| **Setup Script** | 10 lines | 50+ lines |

## 🔄 Can I Switch Later?

**YES!** You can migrate from simplified to global-app when needed:

```bash
# Start simple
myapp-dev/
myapp-staging/
myapp-prod/

# Later, when you need multi-region
myapp-base/ (was dev)
├── myapp-qa/
│   ├── myapp-us-staging/
│   ├── myapp-eu-staging/
│   └── myapp-asia-staging/
```
