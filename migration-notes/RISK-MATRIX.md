## Critical Risks (Score ≥ 9)

### R1: Service Dependency Cascade Failure

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R1 |
| **Category** | Technical - Architecture |
| **Probability** | High (3) |
| **Impact** | Critical (4) |
| **Risk Score** | 12 |
| **Priority** | **CRITICAL** |

**Description**: If reference-data service fails during deployment, all downstream services (7 services) will fail to start, causing complete system failure.

**Root Cause**:
- reference-data is the foundational service providing master data
- All other services have hard dependencies on reference-data
- No fallback or degraded mode available

**Impact**:
- Complete deployment failure
- 2-4 hour recovery time
- Trading platform unavailable
- Potential financial losses for users

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Ordered Deployment with Health Checks** (Primary)
   ```bash
   # bin/ordered-apply ensures reference-data is fully healthy before proceeding
   for order in {0..9}; do
     cub unit apply $unit --space $SPACE
     timeout 60s bash -c "while [[ $(get-health-status) != 'Running' ]]; do sleep 2; done"
   done
   ```

2. **Pre-Deployment Validation** (Secondary)
   ```bash
   # Validate reference-data in isolation before full deployment
   cub unit apply reference-data-deployment --space $(bin/proj)-dev
   kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l service=reference-data --timeout=120s
   ```

3. **Rollback Trigger** (Tertiary)
   ```bash
   # Automatic rollback if reference-data fails
   if ! health_check_passes "reference-data"; then
     cub unit destroy --space $(bin/proj)-dev --filter $(bin/proj)/all
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Maximum 3 retry attempts before rollback
   - 30-second timeout per service startup

**Owner**: Deployment Agent
**Status**: Mitigation implemented in bin/ordered-apply

### R2: ConfigHub Space Quota Exhaustion

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R2 |
| **Category** | Operational - Infrastructure |
| **Probability** | High (3) |
| **Impact** | Critical (4) |
| **Risk Score** | 12 |
| **Priority** | **CRITICAL** |

**Description**: Current ConfigHub quota is 97/100 spaces. TraderX requires 5 spaces, but 25 test spaces have BridgeWorkers preventing deletion.

**Root Cause**:
- Test spaces not properly cleaned up
- BridgeWorkers create locks preventing space deletion
- Manual intervention required to remove workers

**Impact**:
- Deployment completely blocked
- Cannot create required spaces
- Project timeline delayed by 2-4 hours

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Immediate Cleanup** (Primary)
   ```bash
   # Manual removal via ConfigHub web UI
   1. Navigate to each test space
   2. Delete BridgeWorker in each space
   3. Delete space after worker removed
   4. Repeat for all 25 spaces
   ```

2. **Automated Cleanup Script** (Secondary)
   ```bash
   # Create cleanup automation for future
   for space in $(cub space list | grep test-); do
     # Delete workers first
     cub worker delete --space $space --all || true
     # Then delete space
     cub space delete $space --force
   done
   ```

3. **Quota Monitoring** (Tertiary)
   ```bash
   # Add quota check to all scripts
   current_spaces=$(cub space list | wc -l)
   if [ $current_spaces -gt 95 ]; then
     echo "⚠️  WARNING: Approaching space quota (${current_spaces}/100)"
   fi
   ```

4. **Space Lifecycle Policy**
   - Implement 30-day TTL for test spaces
   - Auto-cleanup of spaces with label `ephemeral=true`
   - Weekly quota audit and cleanup

**Owner**: Architecture Agent
**Status**: **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** - Blocks all deployment

### R3: Trade Service Downtime During Production Deployment

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R3 |
| **Category** | Operational - Availability |
| **Probability** | Medium (2) |
| **Impact** | Critical (4) |
| **Risk Score** | 8 |
| **Priority** | **CRITICAL** |

**Description**: Financial trading service (trade-service) experiencing downtime during production deployment violates SLA and causes financial impact.

**Root Cause**:
- Rolling updates may cause brief unavailability
- No blue-green deployment strategy
- Database migration during deployment

**Impact**:
- Trading platform unavailable for 30-120 seconds
- Potential financial losses ($1000-$5000/minute)
- Regulatory compliance violations (SEC, FINRA)
- Customer trust erosion

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Blue-Green Deployment** (Primary)
   ```bash
   # Deploy to parallel "green" environment
   cub unit create trade-service-v2 --space $(bin/proj)-prod \
     --upstream-unit $(bin/proj)-staging/trade-service

   # Test green environment
   # Switch ingress to green when validated
   # Keep blue for instant rollback
   ```

2. **Zero-Downtime Rolling Update** (Secondary)
   ```yaml
   # In trade-service-deployment.yaml
   spec:
     strategy:
       type: RollingUpdate
       rollingUpdate:
         maxSurge: 2
         maxUnavailable: 0  # Zero unavailable pods during rollout
     replicas: 3  # Minimum 3 for availability
   ```

3. **Pre-deployment Testing** (Tertiary)
   ```bash
   # Require 24-hour staging soak test
   staging_uptime=$(get_uptime $(bin/proj)-staging trade-service)
   if [ $staging_uptime -lt 86400 ]; then
     echo "❌ Staging must be stable for 24 hours before prod"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

4. **Maintenance Window Strategy**
   - Schedule deployments during off-peak hours (2-4 AM EST)
   - Pre-announce maintenance windows 48 hours in advance
   - Have rollback plan tested and ready

**Owner**: Deployment Agent
**Status**: Blue-green strategy to be implemented in Phase 3
